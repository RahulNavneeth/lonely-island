# LONELY-ISLAND IN RUST

This program counts the number of islands in a grid. A land is represented by the character '1' and water as '0'.

## USAGE

1. Make sure you have Rust installed on your system.

2. Create a text file containing the grid representation. The grid should be a rectangular shape and consist of characters '0' and '1'. Each character represents a cell in the grid.

3. Save the grid file with a ".txt" extension.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

5. Run the program using the following command:

   ```shell
   cargo run <path_to_grid_file.txt>
   ```
